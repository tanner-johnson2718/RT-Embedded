- AMP: multi CPU w/ OS instance on each, Message pasing inbetween, each core
    runs its own workload. No shared memory.

- SMP: One OS instance managing multiple core, shared memory, one OS irq handler
       CPU migration, load balancing

- Priority Preemptive, Run to Copmletetion): Highest prio task always ran, 
otherwise runs to completion

Fair vs Unfair + det sched)
- SCHED_FIFO : Priority Preemtive Run to completion
    - Task runs at priority until:
        - Complete and exit
        - Yield, sleep, block, etc.
        - IRQ raised

- SHCED_RR - Fix priority Preemtive. Fair, higher overhead + det. Each task
gets some CPU time in RR fashion.

- SCHED_DEADLINE - Dynamic priority alternative - adaptive + hard to model

- SCHED_OTHER - CFS - fair + hard to model
