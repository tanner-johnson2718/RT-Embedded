Outline)
- RT response time line
- Sime service set 2-5 by hand analysis
- More compled service sets can analyzed using worst case tools
    - O(n^3) 
- Worst case analysis was shown to be exact (nes + sufficient) by Lehoczky,
  Sha, and Ding. "The rate monotonic scheduling algo: exact charcaterization
  and average case behavior.

- IO latency
- Interference time

         suspended

- Delay = sleeping
- Pending = waiting on resource like semaphore
- suspended = unhandled exception / taskSuspend()

- Shortest period -> highest priority
