Scheduling Linux)
- Review week1 sequencer (not best practice)
- week 1 generic sequencer is best practice

General Observations)
- CPU cores range from 100Mhz to sever GHz
- 1000 instruction in one us on GHZ CPU core
- Thread scheduled procesing down to 1ms
- ISR processing down to 1us
- Co processor, instruction below 1us to sub ns

RM assumptions and Contraints of RM LUB (Lui and Layland))
- A1) All services requested on contatant period
- A2) Completion time < period
- A3) All services requests are independant
- A4) run time is known and det.
- C1) deadline = period
- C2) Fixed priority, premmptive, run to completion scheduling
- Critical instant - all services requested at once
- No other shared resources i.e. memory
