-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How is atomicity garentted / imlemented in linux semaphores?
- What is this unlink business, is it named? named vs unnamed
- How does a semaphore interact with a fork operation
- Look at mutex implementation

Theory
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- RM LUB understand better
- dead line monotonic
- LuLu paper
- POSIX Linux Threading paper
- Sched Dead line paper

- Can every core get all irq's. How to mask a core form ints
- Signal vs int
- linux run levels
- dig into timer implementation

Scheduler Inquiry)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Use thread affinity code and print out the RT FIFO in kernel
   - Put breaks for code where FIFO is manipulated
   - Break at scheduling events
- Make sure your analysis in RT threads code review is right
- Does pthread_create block??
   - how do i detect if a thread blocks
- Maybe even implement my own sched?
